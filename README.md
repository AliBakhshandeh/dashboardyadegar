## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Since this is a static HTML/JS/CSS project, you can run it in two ways:

### 1. Open in Browser
Just double-click `index.html` (or `login.html`) to open it directly in your browser.  
⚠️ Note: Some features (like AJAX requests) may not work without a local server.

### 2. Run with a Local Server (Recommended)

Install [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) (a simple Node.js static server):

```bash
# install globally
npm install -g serve

# run the project in the current folder
serve .
```

Then open your browser at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
